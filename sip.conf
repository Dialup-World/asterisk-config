; If you are new and setting up Asterisk for the first
; time, you almost definitely should be using PJSIP
; instead of SIP. SIP has been deprecated for years
; and will be removed soon from Asterisk. PJSIP is
; recommended to future-proof your config. This is
; provided for historical and compatability purposes only.

[general]
;bindport=16555   ;set it to a UDP port and never tell anyone what it is! Do not forward the port in your router
; bindport sets all 3 at once. TCP and UDP should be the same, TLS should be a different port. ATAs will need to specify the port
tcpbindaddr=0.0.0.0:16555 ; SIP over TCP (default is 5060)
udpbindaddr=0.0.0.0:16555 ; SIP over UDP (default is 5060)
tlsbindaddr=0.0.0.0:16556 ; SIP over TLS (default is 5061)
;do not use port 5600 for external SIP connections; change your port to something non-standard i.e. bindport=39145 pick a port between 16383 and 65535 and never tell anyone what port you are using! Do not forward that UDP port in your router and ensure that UDP port 5600 is not forwarded in your router either. Indeed you should not need RTP UDP ports (usually 10000-20000) forwarded either.
